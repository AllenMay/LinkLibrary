# Defensive Coding in C# by Deborah Kurata
Resources: [https://github.com/DeborahK/CSharp-Defense](https://github.com/DeborahK/CSharp-Defense)  

Learn techniques for strengthening your application’s defenses against the perils awaiting it in the real world. You will see how to write clean code, create unit tests, build clear methods, and prepare for the unexpected.

Great applications perform required operations as expected, help users enter correct data, handle system and application exceptions, and make it easy for future developers to modify and maintain the code. Defensive coding focuses on improving code comprehension through clean code, improving code quality with unit tests, and improving code predictability by building clear methods and preparing for the unexpected. In this course, Defensive Coding in C#, you will gain the ability to strengthen your application’s defenses against the perils awaiting it in the real world. First, you will learn how to improve your code comprehension by following techniques such as the Single Responsibility principle. Next, you will discover how to improve your code quality through unit tests. Finally, you will explore how to improve your code predictability by validating method arguments, handling nulls appropriately, returning predictable results, and managing exceptions. When you are finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge needed to strengthen your code’s defenses.

## Why Defensive Code Matters  
__What Are We Defending Our Code From?__  
- Incorrect Entry  
  - Add Validation  
- Inalid Operations  
  - Check arguments  
  - Unit test operations  
- System mishaps  
  - Add checks  
  - Manage exceptions  
- Future Developers  
  - Write clean code  
  - Rerun unit tests  
  
__What is Defensive Coding?__  


>__[Defensive programming (coding)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming)__ is an approach to improve software and source code, in terms of:
>
>General quality – reducing the number of software bugs and problems.
>Making the source code comprehensible – the source code should be readable and understandable so it is approved in a code >audit.
>Making the software behave in a predictable manner despite unexpected inputs or user actions. - Wikipedia  

__Defensive Coding Helps Us Improve:__
- Code comprehension 
- Code quality  
- Code predicability  

__Competing Goals:__
- INCREASE CODE: Improving code predictability by __writing more validation and exception management code__  
- REDUCE CODE: Improving code comprehension by __eliminating unnecessary code__  

__Fitness for a Purpose__  
__Risk vs. Defenses__
