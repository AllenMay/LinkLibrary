INTRODUCTION
Want to write great maintainable code, even when faced with constantly changing requirements, Legacy issues, intensive time pressures, and a repidly evolving environment, and want to keep that code great after maintenance activities, multiple developers, and the ravages of time? Welcome to Defensive Coding in C#.

This course will teach you how to write great, maintainable code, and keep that code great using defensive coding techniques.

WHAT IS DEFENSIVE CODING?  
>  ... an approach to improve software and source code, in terms of:  
> - General **quality** - Reducing the number of software bugs and problems.  
> - Making the source code **comprehensible** - the source code should be readable and understandable so it is approved in a code audit.  
> - Making the software behave in a **predictable** manner despite unexpected inputs or user actions.  
\- Wikipedia as of 4/14/2014  

The process of restructuring your code without changing its behavior is called **Refactoring**; the cleaner your code, the easier it is to understand, maintain, and test. 

CLEAN CODE  
  - Improves Compreshension
  - Simplifies Maintenance
  - Reduces Bugs
  
 TESTABLE CODE + UNIT TESTS
   - Improves Quality
   - Confirms Maintenance
   - Reduces Bugs
   
 VALIDATION + EXCEPTION HANDLING
   - Improves Predictablity
   - More Consistent
   - Reduces Bugs

## Clean Code

**Good code vs Bad code**  
  - Bad code has a 'code smell'
  - Write Good code following clean coding techniques
  - Transform Bad code to Good code through refactoring
  
**Clean Code** has the following characteristics:
  - Easy to read
  - Clear intent
  - Simple
  - Minimal
  - Thoughtfull
  
## Refactoring
The act of restructuring code to make it clearer, cleaner, and testable, without changing its behavior is called Refactoring.
