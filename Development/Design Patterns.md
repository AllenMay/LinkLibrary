# Design Patterns

As the Gang of Four note in their book, there are
three types of design patterns:  
- **Creational patterns** deal with the creation of objects and instances.
- **Structural patterns** deal with the structure of classes and code.
- **Behavioral patterns** deal with the behavior of objects.

## Inheritance
-	Inheritance is a core principle of OO programming  
    - Inheritance uses ‘IS-A’  
-	When you overuse inheritance, you can end up with designs that are quite inflexible and not amendable to change.  

## Composition  
- Composition uses ‘HAS-A’
