# Design Patterns

As the Gang of Four note in their book, there are
three types of design patterns:  
- **Creational patterns** deal with the creation of objects and instances.
- **Structural patterns** deal with the structure of classes and code.
- **Behavioral patterns** deal with the behavior of objects.
