__Four Pillars of OOP__  
  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  
__Constructor__  
A special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes an object of that type.  
  
__Key Steps__  
  - Identifying Classes
  - Represents business entities
  - Defines properties (data)
  - Defines methods (actions/behavior)  
  
__Separating Responsibilities (Separation of Concerns)__
  - Minimizes coupling  
    - The degree to which classes are dependant on each other  
    - Low coupling makes better testability and maintainability  

__Maximizes cohesion__
  - The measure of how related everything in a class is to the purpose of the class
  - High cohesion makes the class easier to maintain and test  

__Simplifies Maintenance__
  - Improves Testability  

__Establishing Relationships__  
  - Define how objects work together to perform the operations of the application
    - Defining relationships
    - Types of relationships
    - Collaboration (“uses a” relationship)
    - Composition (“has a” relationship)  
      - Aggregation is a special type of composition where by the component parts do not exist except as part of the composition  
    - Composition: References
    - Composition: Ids
    - Inheritance (“is a” relationship)

__Leveraging Reuse__
  - Involves extracting commonality
  - And building reusable classes/components
    - Build it once
    - Test it once
    - Update it once
    - Enhance it once

__NOTE:__ By convention, the class responsible for retrieving and saving the data for an entity is called a ‘Repository Class’

__Design Pattern:__ Repository Pattern
